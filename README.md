- Techniques Used:  
  - Sentiment Analysis using VADER  
  - Topic Modeling using LDA (Gensim)  
  - Data Cleaning & Tokenization  
  - WordCloud & Multiple Visualizations

 ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, gensim, praw, pyLDAvis)
- NLP with VADER (for sentiment classification)
- Topic Modeling with Gensim LDA
- Reddit API via `praw`
